INSTALL
=======

For Linux and Unix users
------------------------
For a system wide installation simply state

	make
	make install

To make a user installation state

	make
	make userinstall

A restart of The GIMP is recommended.

Other platforms
---------------
I'm sorry I have no knowledge on how to install plugins on other platforms. I
hope others will find a way.
