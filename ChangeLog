ChangeLog
=========

wavelet-denoise v0.3.1 - translations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added translations:
  - Estonian (thanks to Jyri Liira)
  - Polish (thanks to Michal Predotka)

wavelet-denoise v0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The dialog window is now in landscape design with the preview on the left.
  The preview window has now a minimal size which increases preview quality.
  Reason for the change was small screens where the dialog would not fit.
- Added icons to the reset buttons.
- Bug fixed for temporarily reset button.
- Threshold slider now with 2 digits.
- A (computationally cheap = fast) method of noise profiling was implemented.
  This made the 'Detail' slider vanishing. Although the profiling is fast it
  slows the processing down compared to before.
- New slider 'Softness' which controls the softness of the thresholding. Soft
  as opposed to hard thresholding.
- Introduced CIELAB colour space.
- Increased reading and writing speed.
- Reorganization of source code and use of Makefiles.
- Translations of the program now possible using gettext.
- Translation to German made.
- Russian translation added (thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine).
- Added Itailian translation (thanks to Carlo Baldassi).

wavelet-denoise v0.2.1 - minor fixes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Threshold now between 0.0 and 10.0 instead of 0 and 10000.
- Pixel values internally changed (has only computational effect).
- Some minor bugs removed.

wavelet-denoise v0.2 - change in noise weighting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Operates on linear data now (not gamma corrected).
- Increased processing speed.
- Interface reorganized.
- Added 'Detail' slider which affects the thresholds dependency on frequency.
- Added tool-tips in the user interface.
- Colour previev of single channels added.
- Button 'Reset temporarily' added for preview.
- Reset buttons added.
- The size of the dialog is saved now.
- Changed default thresholds.
- Progress bar bugfix done.
- Minor fixes.

wavelet-denoise v0.1.1 - bug fix

- minor memory bug fixed
- some debug g_print() functions removed
- files AUTHORS, ChangeLog, THANKS added

wavelet-denoise v0.1 - first release
